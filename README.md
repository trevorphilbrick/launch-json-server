#launch-json-server
This is a simple Node.sj app to launch the json-server on port 3001 with a 2000 ms delay. It is packaged by the "pkg" package from Vercel. 

### How to install

1. Navigate to the build directory in the repo
2. Click on the install for your operating system
3. Click the download icon in the top-right corner to download the executable file.
4. Drop the executable into the root of your json-server( wherever you would normally navigate to with the terminal).
5. Run the executable
6. If all is working correctly, you should see an empty terminal open up. This is the terminal your server is running in. Closing it will close the server.
7. You can test it is working by visiting "http://localhost:3001/<endpoint-name>" in your browser. If you receive a response back, it's working!

### contribution

Feel free to contribute to this! Some simple things to add would be the ability to pass in parameters to specify port number and delay time.
